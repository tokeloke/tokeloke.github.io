## Bio

My name is Toke Jensen and I am a 27 year old programmer from Copenhagen, Denmark. I am a passionate gamer and free time game developer, who wants to find a job in game industry, because this is what I love to do. In 2014, I moved to Paris, France where I am still living and working. 

## Game: Shelly Ann and the Zombie Surf

Shelly Ann and the Zombie Surf is a project that I am currently writing in my own 
custom game engine that I call the Shelly Engine. The game is a 2D fighting game
where the warrior princess Shelly Ann fight her way through a post apocalyptic
world where modern music has turned people into brainless zombies.

The game is made in collaboration with Peter Almen, who is the game and sound designer, while I am the sole programmer on the project. We created and recorded the soundtrack of the game together in a surf rock style to compliment the dark and aggressive atmosphere.
