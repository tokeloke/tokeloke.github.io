## Bio

My name is Toke Jensen and I am a 27 year old programmer from Copenhagen, Denmark. 

## Game: Shelly Ann and the Zombie Surf

Shelly Ann and the Zombie Surf is a game that I am currently writing in my own 
custom game engine that I call the Shelly Engine. The game is a 2D fighting game
where the warrior princess Shelly Ann fight her way through a post apocalyptic
world where modern music has turned people into brainless zombies.
