# Presentation

## Bio

My name is Toke Jensen and I am a 27 year old programmer from Copenhagen, Denmark. I am a passionate gamer and free time game developer, who wants to find a job in game industry, because this is what I love to do. In 2014, I moved to Paris, France where I am still living and working.

Shelly Ann and the Zombie Surf is a game, that I am currently writing in my little homemade
game engine that I call the Shelly Engine. It is a 2D fighting game
where the warrior Shelly Ann fights her way through a post apocalyptic
world where modern music has turned people into brainless zombies.

The game is made in collaboration with Peter Almen, who is the game and sound designer, while I am the sole programmer on the project. We created and recorded the soundtrack of the game together in a surf rock style to compliment the dark and aggressive atmosphere. The goal is to make the game into a fun retro fighting game with great music and atmosphere, as well as a story told through visual novel inspired cutscenes.

In the Game section, I will do a presentation of the game, the artstyle and the music. There will also be a video of the gameplay and in the future, the goal is to put a playable demo of the game ready to download and install.

In the Engine section, I will do a presentation of the Shelly Engine. I will discuss the differents parts that already exist, as well as discuss how to move forward with it. The engine is written in C++ and the source code is available on my Github Page.
